## UK-DALE: inferring electronic appliance from household voltage and current time series data
_date: September 2021_

My code directory for the UK-DALE project ([datasets](https://jack-kelly.com/data/)). These files will help me revisit the project in the future since they automate all the reading, cleaning, label generation and some custom plotting scripts. Not included is the actual supervised learning (model fitting, algorithm spot-checking cross validation and final tuning). However I want to rework that part anyway, using what I had learned in 2021. A report will go into more detail on the mistakes I made (and on some of the things I did right).

### TO-DO:
* Attempt the classification tasks again, using the more advanced theory I have learned this year (CNNs, better hyperparameter selection)
* Compare with the previous approach, highlighting my mistakes, what I learned, etc.
